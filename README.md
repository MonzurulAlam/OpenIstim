### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of this project is to develop a miniature transcutaneous electrical stimulator for non-invasive muscle and nerve stimulation.

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify"> Block diagram of a constant current electrical stimulator (OpenExoStim) for non-invasive muscle and nerve stimulation. The heart of the stimulator is a constant current pump or a voltage-to-current (V/I) converter. The stimulator utilizes a precision V/I converter to convert biphasic voltage pulses into constant current pulses. The voltage pulses are generated by digital commands to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) circuit. A small series resistor is used in the output loop to sense the output current through the tissue. The sensed voltage lets the stimulator know the status of the output loop and closely monitor each stimulation pulse to prevent any undesired stimulation.

### DISCLAIMER:
<P align="justify"> The design is offered as it is. Although it has been regorously tested with utmost care and to the best of my knowledge, I do not provide any warranty in any aspect.

### WARNING:
- The design is intended stricktly for research and education purposes.
- The stimulator is not approved for human or animal use without receving prior approval from a local ethics committee such as Institutional Review Board.
- The stimulator can generate high voltage and under no circumstances it should be placed across the chest or close to the heart.
- The stimulator should never be powered from external adapter, USB or power source while being used or connected to the body.
