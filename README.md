# OpenExoStim
Open Source Electrical Stimulator

### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of this project is to develop a miniature constant current electrical stimulator for non-invasive muscle and nerve stimulation.

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify"> Block diagram of a constant current electrical stimulator (OpenExoStim) for non-invasive muscle and nerve stimulation. The stimulator is built with commercially off the shelf compotents and powered by a battery. A linear potentiometer is used to vary the stimulation intensity as well as power on and off the stimulator.
