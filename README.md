# OpenExoStim
Open Source Transcutaneous Current Stimulator

### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of this project is to develop a miniature transcutaneous electrical stimulator for non-invasive muscle and nerve stimulation.

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify"> Block diagram of a constant current electrical stimulator (OpenExoStim) for non-invasive muscle and nerve stimulation. The heart of the stimulator is a constant current pump or a voltage-to-current (V/I) converter. The stimulator utilizes a precision V/I converter to convert biphasic voltage pulses into constant current pulses. The voltage pulses are generated by digital commands to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) circuit. A small series resistor is used in the output loop to sense the output current through the tissue. The sensed voltage lets the stimulator know the status of the output loop and closely monitor each stimulation pulse to prevent any undesired stimulation.
